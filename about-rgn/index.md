******The Reflection Groups Network aims to create a space for exchange between researchers from all areas of mathematics in which the concept of groups with mirror symmetries naturally occurs.***

Reflection groups and Coxeter groups can be approached from algebraic, geometric, topological and combinatorial perspectives. 
They are deeply intertwined with a wide range of natural algebraic, combinatorial and geometric structures and play a central role across many areas of mathematics. Instances of the appearence of reflection groups include:
- symmetry groups of regular and abstract polytopes,
- Weyl groups in Lie theory, representation theory and Cluster algebras via root systems,
- (quotients of) Artin--Tits (braid) groups,
- discrete reflection groups on quadratic spaces,
- examples of non-positively curved (CAT(0)) groups, and
- arithmetic reflection groups defined over number fields.
- abstractly defined cousins with similar presentations, e.g. Dyer groups
  
Understanding the properties of these groups, whether finite or infinite, is often key to understanding the structures built upon them. 
The variety of contexts in which they appear naturally invites a diversity of techniques and viewpoints. 

# Mission

We aim to bring together researchers from these strongly interconnected and vibrant areas, fostering exchange on recent developments and shared perspectives on common structures through:
- the RGN online seminar;
- the organization of an annual event like a workshop, a school or a conference (labelled 'RGN-event' on this site);
- promote scientific events in relation to the RGN aim.

*RGN is an inclusive network, the above subkjects are mentionned for information. Please contact us of any subject in which the noton of groups with mirror symmetries appear.*

The RGN is born out of discussions in 2012 between Matthew Dyer, Christophe Hohllweg and Vincent Pilaud.
