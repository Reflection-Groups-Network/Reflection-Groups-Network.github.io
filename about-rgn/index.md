***The Reflection Groups Network aims to create a space for reflection on areas where the notion of groups and symmetries naturally appear.***

Reflection groups and Coxeter groups can be approached from algebraic, geometric, topological and combinatorial perspectives. 
They are deeply intertwined with a wide range of natural algebraic and geometric structures and play a central role across many areas of mathematics. 
Instances of reflection groups include:
- symmetry groups of regular and abstract polytopes,
- quotients of Artin--Tits (braid) groups,
- examples of non-positively curved (CAT(0)) groups,
- discrete reflection groups in geometric group theory,
- arithmetic reflection groups defined over number fields, and
- Weyl groups in Lie theory, representation theory and theory og Cluster algebras via root systems.

Understanding the properties of these groups, whether finite or infinite, is often key to understanding the structures built upon them. 
The variety of contexts in which they appear naturally invites a diversity of techniques and viewpoints. 

*This network aims to bring together researchers from these strongly interconnected and vibrant areas, fostering exchange on recent developments and shared perspectives on common structures.*

The RGN is born out of discussions in 2012 between Matthew Dyer, Christophe Hohllweg and Vincent Pilaud.
